terate over a dictionary

Iterating over a dictionary in Python allows you to access and process its elements, which are key-value pairs.
Iterating Over Keys:

By default - iterating over a dictionary iterates over its keys.

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "location": "New York"}
for key in my_dict:
    print("Key:", key)

Iterating Over Values:

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "location": "New York"}
for value in my_dict.values():
    print("Value:", value)

Iterating Over Key-Value Pairs:

To iterate over key-value pairs, you can use the items() method.

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "location": "New York"}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print("Key:", key, ", Value:", value)
